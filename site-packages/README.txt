mingus is a core Sidewiner dependency. It was written in Python 2 and has been updated to work with Sidewinder.

This folder is used to sync mingus edits into the git repo, and currently should be installed manually for use with Sidewinder.
The interpreter uses a different mingus version which is installed in my Music venv (C:\Users\Sam\Anaconda3\envs\Music\Lib\site-packages\mingus) and is not synced into the git repo. 
Therefore any updates to mingus code should be made in both places.
