mingus is a dependency installed in the Music venv (C:\Users\Sam\Anaconda3\envs\Music\Lib\site-packages\mingus), which is not synced into the git repo. It was written in python 2 and has been edited to work with Sidewinder.

This folder provides a copy of the edited mingus code, to be installed manually.
